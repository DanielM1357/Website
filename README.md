WMC Project WS25/26

## Description
This Website is a school project in order to learn Web Development with HTML, CSS and JavScript.
It contains three Webpages, which are all linked to each other via the menu. The first page contains a little 
description about me, and also a download link for a file with 'loremipsum' text.
On the second page there is some information about the background image and also a form
which is validated by JavaScript. The third page has a little JavaScript Dicer application, where
you can simply roll a dice, with a little animation.
